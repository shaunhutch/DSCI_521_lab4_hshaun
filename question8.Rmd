## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### New Code Chunk 1
\n 
The code chunk below combines three values together in a list.
```{r New Code Chunk 1}
x <- 1
y <- 3
z <- -25
answer <- c(x, y, z)
answer
```
#### New Code Chunk 2
\n
This code chunk takes the average from the list in code chunk 1
```{r New Code Chunk 2}
library(tidyr)
avg_answer <- sum(answer)/length(answer)
avg_answer
```
